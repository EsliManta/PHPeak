# PHPeak
A PHP framework built for peak performance.

# Origin
This just started as a project for me to learn to manage big projects, and as a sideproject. One of many I may add. I'm just a week in and it's already transforming into C# code in PHP but I mean C# is an amazing language. I just love Generics and LINQ so although this project will be PSR compliant, expect some C# styled code.

# Usage
Custom code can be added to the `src` folder. It will be autoloaded :)
